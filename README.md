# Welcome to my Local Cafe Project Website!

## This project is a Local Cafe Website to demenstrate my skills and experience

### Project Brief
 To achieve and complete this project, I need to create a portfolio website which achieves the following factors:
 * Have a Home Page / Section
 * Have a About Page / Section
 * Have a Contact Page / Section
 * Have a Category Page / Section
 * Have a Products Page / Section
 * Have good accessibility
 * Be Responsive
 * Include Graphics
 * Use 3 colours but keep it clean
 * Use Clean Code

 ### Approach
 How did I approach the brief?
 I began by planning out what pages I will need to include based on the brief, I then chose the colours and began creating the website, testing responsiveness as I developed the website.

 Biggest challenge?
 The biggest challenge in the developing of this project was thinking of how the menu is going to fit, and how to include the catergory and products page neatly.

 ### Future Improvements
 If I had more time and better resources, how would I change or improve this project?

 If I did have more time, I'd like to spend more time on designing and developing the navbar, as although it works fine, it doesn't look as nice when in mobile view. Adding this would further improve the user-friendliness and responsiveness. I would also add an arrow up button that takes you to the top of the page. With this project, I decided to keep the navbar at the top, and therefore navigating through the website might be harder for some. Although adding the arrow up button would help, it's not essential as the website itself is not very big so there isn't much scrolling that needs to happen.
